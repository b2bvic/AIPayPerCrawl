# Associated Press + OpenAI Licensing Deal: Contract Structure and Lessons for Publishers

**Associated Press** announced its **OpenAI** partnership in July 2023. The news wire service that supplies content to half the world's news organizations became one of the first major publishers to license content for AI training.

The deal attracted attention for what it represented. Not for what it paid.

**AP** disclosed almost nothing about financial terms. No dollar figures. No payment structure. No enforcement mechanisms. The announcement emphasized "exploring generative AI" and "sharing technology and product expertise." Partnership language. Not licensing language.

That opacity is the story. What **AP** revealed tells publishers what to announce. What **AP** concealed tells publishers what to negotiate.

This teardown analyzes the public terms, infers the deal structure from industry comparisons, and extracts lessons for publishers pursuing their own AI licensing agreements.

## Deal Overview and Public Terms

### What AP Disclosed (Timeline, Scope, Partnership Framing)

The **AP-OpenAI** announcement came July 13, 2023. Two paragraphs of substance. The rest was positioning.

**Disclosed elements:**
- **OpenAI** licensed **AP's** text archive
- **AP** would use **OpenAI** technology to explore "generative AI use cases"
- Agreement covered news content from **AP's** archive
- Both parties described the arrangement as a "partnership"

**Timeline context:** This deal closed before **News Corp's** $250 million announcement. Before **Reddit's** $60 million **Google** agreement. Before **Financial Times** partnered with **Anthropic**. **AP** moved early without public pricing benchmarks.

| Announcement Element | What AP Said | What It Means |
|---------------------|--------------|---------------|
| Financial terms | Not disclosed | Below headline threshold or structured unusually |
| Content scope | "Text archive" | Likely historical news, unclear on real-time feeds |
| Duration | Not specified | Probably multi-year given partnership framing |
| Exclusivity | Not mentioned | Likely non-exclusive given AP's syndication model |

The partnership framing matters. **AP** didn't frame this as selling content. They framed it as exploring AI together. That language suggests the deal included non-financial components: technology access, product collaboration, or research partnerships that offset a lower cash payment.

### What AP Didn't Disclose (Financial Terms, Enforcement Mechanisms)

Every critical commercial term went unannounced.

**Missing from public disclosure:**
- Payment amount (flat fee, per-crawl, or hybrid)
- Payment structure (upfront, annual, usage-based)
- Content scope specifics (which archives, how far back, what formats)
- Attribution requirements (how **ChatGPT** must cite **AP** content)
- Audit rights (whether **AP** can verify **OpenAI's** usage)
- Enforcement provisions (what happens if terms are violated)
- Termination clauses (exit conditions for either party)

This silence was deliberate. Early licensing deals faced uncertainty about market pricing. Disclosing terms would have anchored expectations. **AP** kept options open by keeping numbers private.

For publishers analyzing this deal: The absence of financial disclosure suggests either the payment was modest by industry standards or the value exchange was primarily non-monetary. **News Corp** announced $250 million because that number reinforced their negotiating position. **AP** didn't announce because silence served theirs.

### Why AP Chose OpenAI First

**OpenAI** offered strategic advantages over other AI companies in 2023.

**Market position:** **ChatGPT** had over 100 million users when this deal closed. No other AI system had comparable distribution. Licensing to **OpenAI** meant **AP** content would reach the largest audience.

**Attribution capability:** **OpenAI** was developing citation features. Earlier **ChatGPT** versions generated answers without sources. Newer versions surfaced links. **AP** likely negotiated attribution requirements as those features developed.

**Technology access:** The partnership framing suggests **AP** received **OpenAI** API access, research collaboration, or product development support. For a news organization exploring AI workflows, this technology exchange had real value.

**First-mover timing:** Being first established **AP** as an AI licensing leader. That positioning attracted subsequent partnerships and reinforced **AP's** role as the news industry's technology pioneer.

| Factor | Why It Favored OpenAI |
|--------|----------------------|
| Distribution | 100M+ ChatGPT users |
| Attribution | Citation features in development |
| Technology | API access and product collaboration |
| Positioning | First-mover credibility |

## What AP Licensed (Content Scope)

### Archives (Historical News Content Depth)

**AP** maintains one of the deepest news archives in existence. Over 175 years of reporting. Billions of archived items. Text, photo, video, graphics.

The **OpenAI** deal covers "text archive." That phrase is deliberately broad.

**Likely included:**
- Wire service dispatches (breaking news text)
- Enterprise journalism (investigative, feature content)
- Historical coverage (pre-digital archive digitization)
- International bureau content (global news network)

**Scope uncertainty:** Did **OpenAI** license the entire historical archive or specific date ranges? Training data value peaks for recent content and declines for material already absorbed by **Common Crawl**. A 2010-2023 license differs substantially from a 1900-2023 license.

Archive depth creates licensing value. **AP's** coverage of every major news event since the 1840s provides training data no other source can replicate. That historical depth justified whatever **AP** charged.

### Real-Time News Feeds (Breaking News Access)

**AP** supplies breaking news to thousands of media outlets globally. That real-time feed has distinct licensing value.

**Retrieval vs. training distinction:**
- Historical archives train models (incorporated into weights during training runs)
- Real-time feeds power retrieval systems (surfaced in responses to current-event queries)

The announcement didn't specify real-time access. But **ChatGPT's** evolution toward current information suggests **OpenAI** sought it. Answering questions about today's news requires today's news.

| Content Type | Training Value | Retrieval Value | Likely Included |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Historical archive | High | Low | Yes (confirmed) |
| Real-time feeds | Moderate | High | Uncertain |
| Breaking news | Low | Very High | Uncertain |

If **AP** licensed real-time feeds, the deal structure likely includes ongoing payments. Flat archive licensing plus usage-based retrieval fees would match the hybrid models seen in later deals.

### Multimedia (Photos, Video, Graphics)

**AP** produces visual content alongside text. Photos from every major news event. Video packages. Data visualizations.

**Text-only confirmation:** The announcement specified "text archive." No mention of **AP Images**, **AP Video**, or other multimedia assets.

This exclusion makes commercial sense. Visual content has different AI training implications. Image generation systems (**DALL-E**, **Midjourney**) face distinct copyright questions. Text models have clearer training use cases.

**AP** likely reserved multimedia licensing for separate negotiations. Keeping visual content out of the **OpenAI** deal preserved optionality for image-focused AI partnerships.

### What Was Explicitly Excluded (AP Stylebook, Proprietary Tools)

**AP Stylebook** is the journalism industry's usage standard. Millions of copies sold. Licensed to media organizations, academic institutions, and software companies.

The **OpenAI** deal almost certainly excluded **Stylebook** content. That product has its own licensing revenue stream. Bundling it with news archive access would undervalue an established commercial asset.

**Other probable exclusions:**
- **AP** election systems and data products
- Client relationship information
- Internal editorial tools and processes
- Unpublished content and internal communications

Scope exclusions protect revenue streams and confidential information. Publishers negotiating their own deals should inventory what stays out, not just what goes in.

## Inferred Deal Structure

### Likely Flat Annual Fee (Based on News Corp Comparisons)

Industry pattern: Major publisher deals use flat annual fees, not per-crawl pricing.

**News Corp:** $50 million annually ($250 million over 5 years)
**Reddit:** $60 million annually
**Financial Times:** Estimated $5 million to $15 million annually

**AP** likely follows this pattern. Per-crawl pricing works for **Cloudflare Pay-Per-Crawl** marketplace transactions. It's uncommon in negotiated direct deals with major publishers.

Flat fees provide predictability. Both parties know the annual commitment. No metering disputes. No payment fluctuation with crawl volume.

### Estimated Value Range ($5M-$15M Annually)

Without disclosure, estimation requires comparison.

**Factors suggesting lower end ($5M-$7M):**
- Early timing (no benchmarks established, pricing discovery phase)
- Partnership framing (technology exchange offsetting cash payment)
- Non-exclusive terms (AP retained rights to license elsewhere)
- Wire service model (AP content is widely syndicated, reducing uniqueness)

**Factors suggesting higher end ($10M-$15M):**
- Archive depth (175+ years of historical coverage)
- Global coverage (international bureaus, comprehensive scope)
- Brand authority (AP as trusted news source, valuable for AI credibility)
- Real-time potential (breaking news feeds if included)

| Valuation Factor | Impact on Price |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Early timing | Reduces (-) |
| Partnership exchange | Reduces (-) |
| Archive depth | Increases (+) |
| Brand authority | Increases (+) |
| Wire syndication model | Neutral |

Best estimate: $5 million to $15 million annually. Lower than **News Corp** due to timing and partnership structure. Higher than zero due to archive value and brand premium.

### Multi-Year Commitment (Stability for Both Parties)

Partnership language suggests multi-year terms. Probably three to five years.

**Rationale:**
- Technology collaboration requires sustained engagement
- Training data investments need predictable access
- Annual renegotiation creates friction both parties avoid

Multi-year commitments benefit publishers through revenue stability. They benefit AI companies through source reliability. The mutual interest produces standard deal structures.

## Attribution and Usage Terms

### How ChatGPT Cites AP Content

**ChatGPT** evolved from no attribution to inline citations. **AP** likely negotiated specific attribution requirements as those features developed.

**Current attribution behavior:**
- Inline source mentions ("According to the Associated Press...")
- Link citations when available
- Brand name inclusion in responses drawing from **AP** content

Attribution creates non-financial value. Every **ChatGPT** citation reinforces **AP** brand authority. Users see **AP** as a trusted source. That brand equity has commercial value separate from licensing payments.

### What Happens When ChatGPT Summarizes Without Attribution

No public enforcement mechanism exists for attribution failures.

If **ChatGPT** generates a response using **AP** training data without citation, what recourse does **AP** have? The answer depends on contract terms that remain undisclosed.

**Likely provisions:**
- Best-efforts attribution (not guaranteed, but required where technically feasible)
- Reporting requirements (OpenAI provides attribution compliance data)
- Remediation process (AP can flag attribution failures for correction)

**Unlikely provisions:**
- Financial penalties per attribution failure
- Automatic contract termination for non-compliance
- Right to remove training data after incorporation

Enforcement is the weak point in attribution agreements. Publishers should negotiate specific remedies, not just requirements.

### Enforcement of Misuse (AP's Recourse If Terms Violated)

**AP's** enforcement options if **OpenAI** violates terms:

**Contractual remedies:**
- Cure period (time to fix violations)
- Payment adjustments (reduced fees for non-compliance)
- Termination rights (exit clause if violations persist)

**Practical limitations:**
- Training data can't be "removed" once incorporated into model weights
- Retrieval data can be blocked but not retroactively controlled
- Legal action is expensive and uncertain

The reality: Enforcement depends on ongoing relationship value. **OpenAI** has incentive to comply because losing **AP** content damages product quality and industry reputation. That incentive matters more than contract language.

## Why This Deal Worked for AP

### Brand Visibility (ChatGPT as New Distribution Channel)

**ChatGPT** processes hundreds of millions of queries daily. When those queries touch news topics, **AP** attribution surfaces the brand to audiences who might never visit **AP** directly.

Distribution economics: Traditional news syndication puts **AP** content in newspapers with **AP** bylines. AI syndication puts **AP** citations in conversational interfaces. Same visibility function, different medium.

For a wire service built on distribution breadth, **ChatGPT** extends reach. That strategic value justified early partnership.

### Revenue Diversification (Declining Ad Revenue, Rising Licensing)

**AP** revenue depends on media industry health. As newspapers declined, **AP's** core customer base contracted. Diversification became strategic necessity.

| Revenue Stream | Trend | AI Licensing Impact |
|----------------|-------|---------------------|
| Wire service subscriptions | Declining | No direct impact |
| AP Images licensing | Stable | Excluded from deal |
| Advertising | Declining | No direct impact |
| AI licensing | New | Additive revenue stream |

AI licensing creates revenue independent of advertising market conditions. Even modest annual payments ($5M-$15M) represent meaningful diversification for an organization with $600M annual revenue.

### Strategic Positioning (First-Mover Advantage in News-AI Partnerships)

Being first established **AP** as the news industry's AI partner of record. That positioning generated benefits beyond the initial deal.

**Subsequent outcomes:**
- Industry credibility for AI engagement
- Inbound interest from other AI companies
- Leadership position in news industry AI discussions
- Technology learning from early partnership

First-mover advantage matters in emerging markets. **AP** captured it.

## What Publishers Can Learn

### Importance of Public Announcement

**AP** announced despite disclosing minimal terms. That announcement served strategic purposes.

**Announcement benefits:**
- Credibility signal to industry
- Leverage for subsequent negotiations (other AI companies know AP has a deal)
- Brand positioning as forward-looking
- Internal stakeholder communication

Publishers closing deals should announce them. The signaling value exceeds the disclosure cost. Terms can stay private while the fact of partnership becomes public.

### Scope Clarity (Defining What's In vs. Out)

**AP** clearly excluded multimedia and **Stylebook**. That scope discipline preserved separate revenue streams.

**Scope questions for publisher deals:**
- Which content sections are included?
- What date ranges apply?
- Is real-time access included or archive-only?
- What formats are covered (text, images, video, data)?
- What products or assets are explicitly excluded?

Define scope precisely. Ambiguity favors AI companies seeking broader access.

### Attribution as Non-Financial Value

**AP** negotiated attribution when citation features were undeveloped. That foresight captured value that emerged later.

Publishers should negotiate attribution requirements even if current AI systems don't support them. Features evolve. Terms should anticipate that evolution.

| Attribution Element | Negotiation Priority |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Inline brand mention | High |
| Link to source | High |
| Logo/visual branding | Medium |
| Response prominence | Medium |
| Traffic referral tracking | High |

### Exclusivity vs. Non-Exclusivity

**AP** almost certainly retained rights to license content to other AI companies. That non-exclusivity explains why terms remained undisclosed.

**Exclusivity trade-off:**
- Exclusive deals command premium pricing
- Non-exclusive deals preserve optionality
- AI companies prefer exclusivity
- Publishers benefit from multiple licensing relationships

**AP** chose optionality. They could subsequently negotiate with **Anthropic**, **Google**, **Meta**, or emerging AI companies. That flexibility has value if the market develops favorably.

For most publishers: Start non-exclusive. You can always negotiate exclusivity later for higher payment. You can't easily unwind exclusivity once granted.

---

## What's Missing From Public Reporting

### Audit Rights (Can AP Verify OpenAI's Usage?)

No public information exists on whether **AP** can audit **OpenAI's** content usage.

**Audit provisions might include:**
- Quarterly reports on content accessed
- Annual compliance certifications
- Third-party audit rights
- Access to usage analytics

Without audit rights, publishers trust AI companies to comply. That trust may or may not be warranted. Negotiate audit provisions explicitly.

### Termination Clauses (What Triggers Deal End)

How can either party exit? The announcement provides no guidance.

**Typical termination triggers:**
- Material breach with cure period expiration
- Bankruptcy or insolvency
- Change of control
- Mutual agreement

Termination matters because AI licensing relationships may span years. Business conditions change. Exit rights provide protection.

### Derivative Works (Can OpenAI Create Summaries, Compilations?)

If **ChatGPT** summarizes **AP** content, does that summary constitute a derivative work? Who owns it?

These questions have significant copyright implications. The **AP** deal almost certainly addresses them. Publishers negotiating their own agreements should too.

**Derivative work considerations:**
- Can AI company create summaries without additional payment?
- Can AI company compile content into new products?
- Who owns AI-generated content drawing from licensed sources?
- What happens to derivative works if the deal terminates?

[INTERNAL: Reddit Deal Teardown]

---

The **AP-OpenAI** deal established that major news organizations would license to AI companies. It didn't establish pricing norms or contract standards. Those emerged later with **News Corp**, **Reddit**, and **Financial Times**.

Publishers analyzing this deal should note the timing. **AP** moved early without benchmarks. They accepted partnership framing and modest disclosure because the market was undefined.

That market is now defined. Later deals provide clearer templates. But the **AP** deal remains instructive for its strategic positioning and scope discipline.

Being first mattered. **AP** captured that advantage. Publishers moving now compete in a market with established expectations. Different timing requires different strategy.
