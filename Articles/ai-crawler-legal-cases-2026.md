## Landmark Publisher Cases

### The New York Times v. OpenAI & Microsoft (S.D.N.Y.)

**Filed:** December 27, 2023

**Plaintiffs:** The New York Times Company

**Defendants:** OpenAI Inc., OpenAI LP, OpenAI GP LLC, OpenAI OpCo LLC, OpenAI Global LLC, Microsoft Corporation

**Case number:** 1:23-cv-11195

**Claims:**

- Copyright infringement (17 USC § 501)
- DMCA violations (removal of copyright management information)
- Vicarious copyright infringement (Microsoft as OpenAI partner)

**Allegations:**

NYT claims OpenAI trained GPT models on millions of copyrighted NYT articles without permission or payment. GPT outputs reproduce NYT content verbatim, compete with NYT journalism, undermine subscription business.

**Evidence:**

NYT provided examples where ChatGPT reproduces substantial NYT article excerpts when prompted. Outputs include NYT-specific reporting details, suggesting direct copying during training.

**Defendants' expected defenses:**

- **Fair use** (transformative AI training)
- **No substantial similarity** (outputs don't copy protectable expression)
- **Cherry-picked examples** (rare instances, not typical behavior)

**Status (Feb 2026):**

- Discovery phase ongoing
- Microsoft filed motion to dismiss (denied in part)
- OpenAI counterclaimed: NYT used GPT API to generate training data for NYT AI features (alleged violation of OpenAI ToS)
- No trial date set (likely 2027)

**Significance:**

**If NYT wins:** Establishes that AI training on news content without licensing violates copyright. Forces AI companies to license or remove news sources from training data. Empowers publishers to demand fees.

**If OpenAI wins:** Validates fair use defense for AI training. Weakens publisher leverage. Licensing becomes optional (AI companies scrape freely under fair use).

### Getty Images v. Stability AI (U.S. & U.K.)

**U.S. Case filed:** February 3, 2023 (D. Delaware)

**U.K. Case filed:** January 2023

**Plaintiff:** Getty Images (US), Inc.

**Defendant:** Stability AI Ltd., Stability AI Inc.

**Case number (U.S.):** 1:23-cv-00135

**Claims:**

- Copyright infringement (scraping 12M+ Getty images without license)
- Trademark infringement (Stable Diffusion outputs include Getty watermarks)
- Unfair competition

**Evidence:**

Stable Diffusion-generated images sometimes display mangled Getty watermark ("Getty Images" text visible but corrupted). **Smoking gun proof** model trained on Getty images.

**Allegations:**

Stability AI scraped Getty's image library to train Stable Diffusion. Outputs compete directly with Getty's stock image business (customers generate similar images instead of licensing).

**Defendants' defense:**

- Fair use (transformative image generation)
- No literal copying (outputs are new creations, not Getty image reproductions)

**Status (Feb 2026):**

**U.S. case:** Discovery ongoing. No trial date.

**U.K. case:** Partially settled (undisclosed terms). Getty continues some claims. Ongoing litigation in U.K. courts.

**Significance:**

Watermark evidence undermines fair use defense (if model reproduces watermarks, suggests non-transformative copying). May establish that image scraping for AI requires licensing.

**Related:** See [ai-content-scraping-legal-landscape.html](ai-content-scraping-legal-landscape.html) for fair use analysis.

### Associated Press v. OpenAI (Settled)

**Filed:** 2023 (case details confidential)

**Parties:** Associated Press, OpenAI

**Outcome:** Settled in July 2024. Terms undisclosed but reportedly include:

- Multi-year content licensing deal
- OpenAI pays AP for access to news archive
- AP gains access to OpenAI technology
- Mutual attribution requirements

**Significance:**

First major news publisher settlement. Establishes licensing as preferred alternative to litigation. Creates precedent for negotiated deals vs. prolonged lawsuits.

## Authors Guild and Writer Litigation

### Authors Guild v. OpenAI (N.D. Cal.)

**Filed:** September 19, 2023

**Plaintiffs:** Authors Guild, individual authors (John Grisham, Jodi Picoult, George R.R. Martin, Jonathan Franzen, others)

**Defendant:** OpenAI Inc., OpenAI LP, etc.

**Case number:** 3:23-cv-04625

**Claims:**

- Copyright infringement (GPT trained on Books3 dataset containing pirated books)
- Violation of authors' derivative works rights
- Unjust enrichment

**Allegations:**

OpenAI trained on copyrighted books without authorization. GPT models can produce detailed summaries, character analyses, plot outlines—derivative works competing with original books. Authors received no compensation.

**Evidence:**

- Books3 dataset (part of The Pile) contains 196,000+ books, many pirated
- ChatGPT produces accurate book summaries when prompted

**OpenAI defense:**

- Fair use (transformative training)
- Outputs don't reproduce substantial book content
- No market harm (summaries don't substitute for reading books)

**Status (Feb 2026):**

- Motion to dismiss denied (case proceeds)
- Class certification pending
- Discovery ongoing
- Trial likely 2027

**Significance:**

Tests whether AI-generated summaries/analyses constitute infringing derivatives. If authors prevail, entire AI training on copyrighted books becomes legally risky.

### Silverman v. Meta (N.D. Cal.)

**Filed:** July 2023

**Plaintiffs:** Sarah Silverman, Christopher Golden, Richard Kadrey (authors)

**Defendant:** Meta Platforms Inc.

**Case number:** 3:23-cv-03417

**Claims:**

Copyright infringement (Llama models trained on pirated books from Books3).

**Status (Feb 2026):**

- Some claims dismissed (failure to state claim)
- Remaining claims proceed
- Consolidated with related cases against Meta

**Related:** Silverman also filed against OpenAI (separate case, similar claims).

### Concord Music Group v. Anthropic (M.D. Tenn.)

**Filed:** October 18, 2023

**Plaintiff:** Concord Music Group Inc. (music publisher representing Universal Music, ABKCO, others)

**Defendant:** Anthropic PBC

**Case number:** 3:23-cv-01092

**Claims:**

- Copyright infringement (Claude reproduces song lyrics)
- Contributory infringement (Anthropic enables user copyright violations)

**Allegations:**

When users prompt Claude to provide song lyrics, Claude reproduces copyrighted lyrics verbatim (no transformation, direct infringement). Examples include lyrics from Chuck Berry, Rolling Stones, Kool & the Gang.

**Evidence:**

Screenshots showing Claude outputting full lyric excerpts. Unlike text generation (summaries, analysis), lyrics are literal reproductions.

**Anthropic defense (expected):**

- DMCA safe harbor (Claude is platform, user directed infringement)
- Fair use (despite weakness given literal reproduction)
- No training on lyrics (lyrics might be in training data, but Anthropic claims filtering)

**Status (Feb 2026):**

- Motion to dismiss pending
- Discovery on hold pending motion resolution

**Significance:**

Lyrics reproduction is hardest case for AI companies to defend (no transformation, clear copying). If Concord prevails, establishes liability for verbatim outputs even if training claimed fair use.

## Visual Art Litigation

### Andersen v. Stability AI, Midjourney, DeviantArt (N.D. Cal.)

**Filed:** January 13, 2023

**Plaintiffs:** Sarah Andersen, Kelly McKernan, Karla Ortiz (visual artists)

**Defendants:** Stability AI Ltd., Midjourney Inc., DeviantArt Inc.

**Case number:** 3:23-cv-00201

**Claims:**

- Copyright infringement (AI models trained on artists' work)
- Right of publicity violations (AI generates art "in the style of" specific artists)
- DMCA violations

**Allegations:**

AI image generators trained on billions of images scraped from internet, including plaintiffs' copyrighted artwork. Generators can produce images mimicking artists' distinctive styles, undermining artists' market.

**Status (Feb 2026):**

- Amended complaints filed (court dismissed some initial claims, plaintiffs refiled)
- Motion to dismiss partially granted, partially denied
- Discovery ongoing

**Key legal question:**

Does training on copyrighted images constitute infringement if outputs are "in the style of" but don't directly copy?

**Significance:**

Tests boundaries of style vs. expression. If artists win, AI image generators must license training data or face liability.

## Emerging Publisher Litigation

### Alden Global Capital (Tribune Publishing, Chicago Tribune, others) v. OpenAI (Filed 2024)

**Filed:** Late 2024 (exact date TBD in public filings)

**Plaintiffs:** Tribune Publishing (Chicago Tribune, New York Daily News, others under Alden ownership)

**Defendants:** OpenAI, Microsoft

**Claims:**

Similar to NYT case—copyright infringement from training on news articles.

**Status (Feb 2026):**

Early stages, discovery beginning.

**Significance:**

Follows NYT precedent. Shows litigation spreading beyond single publisher to industry-wide pattern.

### Dow Jones (Wall Street Journal) v. AI Companies (Rumored)

**Status:** Reportedly considering litigation or in pre-litigation negotiations (as of Feb 2026). No public filing yet.

**Potential claims:** Copyright infringement, contractual breach if scraping violated WSJ ToS.

**Alternative outcome:** Licensing deals (WSJ parent News Corp already licensed to OpenAI in 2024).

## Outcomes and Settlements

### Cases Settled or Dismissed

**AP v. OpenAI:** Settled (licensing deal).

**Axel Springer (Politico, Business Insider) v. OpenAI:** Avoided via licensing deal (announced Dec 2023 before litigation).

**News Corp (WSJ, New York Post, others) v. OpenAI:** Avoided via licensing (announced May 2024).

**Several author cases:** Dismissed with prejudice (failures to state claims, refiled with amendments).

**Pattern:** Major publishers increasingly choosing licensing over litigation. Settlements more common than trial verdicts.

### Preliminary Rulings Favoring Defendants

**GitHub Copilot cases (Doe v. GitHub):** Some claims dismissed (court found insufficient direct infringement allegations). Case continues on remaining claims.

**Stability AI motion to dismiss:** Partially successful (some artist claims dismissed, case not killed entirely).

**Interpretation:** Courts skeptical of weak claims but allowing well-pleaded copyright cases to proceed.

### Preliminary Rulings Favoring Plaintiffs

**Authors Guild:** Motion to dismiss denied (case survives, proceeds to discovery).

**Getty:** U.S. case survived motion to dismiss.

**Interpretation:** Courts recognize AI copyright claims have merit, won't dismiss at early stage without evidence.

## Implications for Publishers

### Licensing Leverage from Litigation

**Even if cases don't reach trial, litigation creates leverage.**

**Example timeline:**

1. Publisher files suit
2. Discovery reveals extent of scraping (evidence of value)
3. AI company faces costly litigation, uncertain outcome
4. Parties settle for licensing deal (AI company pays, litigation ends)

**This happened with AP, News Corp, Axel Springer.**

**Implication:** **Litigation threat is negotiation tool.** Don't need to win in court—need to create enough legal risk that licensing is cheaper than defending lawsuit.

### Fair Use Uncertainty

**No definitive Supreme Court ruling yet.** Until high court decides, fair use for AI training remains unsettled.

**Current state:**

- Lower courts split (some sympathetic to fair use, others to copyright holders)
- Discovery in major cases (NYT, Authors Guild) will produce evidence shaping analysis
- Likely 3-5 years before appellate clarity

**Publisher strategy:**

**Don't wait for legal certainty.** Negotiate licenses now while uncertainty benefits publishers (AI companies pay to avoid risk).

### Class Action Opportunities

**Several cases structured as class actions** (Authors Guild allows any author whose books in Books3 to join).

**For small publishers:**

Individual litigation expensive. Class actions allow participation with minimal cost.

**Monitor:**

- Class certification rulings (when court approves class, eligible publishers can opt in)
- Settlement negotiations (class settlements might provide payment to all members)

**Consult legal counsel:** Joining class action waives individual litigation rights but provides low-cost participation.

### Jurisdictional Considerations

**Cases filed in multiple jurisdictions:**

- **S.D.N.Y.** (New York Times case—favorable to publishers, major media hub)
- **N.D. Cal.** (San Francisco federal court—tech-friendly, but copyright precedents strong)
- **D. Del.** (Delaware—neutral, common for IP litigation)

**U.S. vs. international:**

- **U.S.:** Fair use defense available (AI companies' strongest argument)
- **U.K./E.U.:** Stronger copyright protections, weaker fair use (publishers have advantage)

**Strategy:** Publishers with international presence consider filing in E.U. jurisdictions for stronger legal footing.

## FAQ

### How long until we get definitive rulings on AI fair use?

**3-5 years minimum.** Current cases (NYT v. OpenAI, Authors Guild) filed 2023-2024. Discovery phase: 1-2 years. Trial: 2025-2027. Appeals: Add 1-2 years. Supreme Court review (if granted): 2028-2030. **Faster resolution possible via settlements** (many cases settle during discovery). **Don't wait for rulings to act**—negotiate licensing now while uncertainty creates AI company willingness to pay.

### Should small publishers join class actions or negotiate individual licenses?

**Depends on content value and resources.** **Join class action if:** (1) Content relatively commoditized (not unique/differentiated), (2) Lack legal budget for individual litigation, (3) AI scraping volume low (licensing fees would be minimal). **Negotiate individual license if:** (1) Content highly specialized/unique (licensing leverage), (2) Heavy scraping volume (evidence of value), (3) Existing relationships with AI companies. **Can do both:** Join class action (reserve rights), separately negotiate license with different AI company.

### What damages are publishers claiming in these lawsuits?

**Varies by case.** **NYT:** Statutory damages (up to $150K per willfully infringed work × thousands of articles = billions potential). Actual damages (lost subscription revenue, licensing fees AI companies should have paid). **Getty:** Similar structure—statutory damages on 12M images. **Authors Guild:** Damages based on book sales harm, unjust enrichment to OpenAI. **Typical publisher claim:** $500M-$5B range depending on content volume and scraping extent. **Reality:** Settlements usually far lower ($10M-$500M depending on publisher size).

### Can publishers sue for past scraping even if AI company stops now?

**Yes. Copyright infringement claims extend back 3 years from filing** (statute of limitations). Training that occurred 2021-2024 actionable in 2024 lawsuit. **But:** AI companies argue training was one-time event (copying during training, not ongoing infringement). **Ongoing infringement:** If AI outputs reproduce content, each output = new infringement. **Strategy:** Even if AI company stops future scraping, past scraping creates liability. Publishers can demand payment for prior unauthorized use.

### How do licensing deals affect pending litigation?

**Settlements typically include:** (1) Licensing agreement (ongoing content access), (2) Payment (lump sum + annual fees), (3) **Dismissal of lawsuit with prejudice** (plaintiff can't refile). **Effect:** Case ends, no precedent set (settlement doesn't create legal ruling). **Trade-off:** Publisher gets immediate payment, loses potential for court victory that would benefit entire industry. **Some publishers sue explicitly for settlement leverage** (litigation threat forces licensing negotiation). **Others sue seeking precedent** (willing to go to trial for industry-wide ruling).
