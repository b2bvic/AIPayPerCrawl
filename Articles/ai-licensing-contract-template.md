# AI Licensing Contract Template: Essential Clauses for Publisher-to-AI Training Data Agreements

**AI training data licensing contracts** govern how **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, **Google**, and enterprise AI buyers access publisher content for model development. Unlike traditional content licensing (syndication, reprints), AI agreements must address unique concerns: model weight persistence (content "baked into" neural networks can't be removed), derivative work creation (AI-generated outputs incorporating publisher content), and attribution requirements in non-human contexts (how does a language model cite sources?). Publishers entering negotiations need contract templates covering consumption limits, overage billing, audit rights, content restrictions, attribution mechanisms, and termination clauses that account for AI's technical realities.

## Core Contract Structure

AI licensing agreements follow standard commercial contract architecture with AI-specific modifications.

## Section 1: Parties and Background

Identify licensors (publishers), licensees (AI companies), and contract purpose.

**Template Language:**

> **CONTENT LICENSING AGREEMENT FOR AI TRAINING**
>
> This Content Licensing Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into as of [DATE] ("Effective Date") by and between:
>
> **Licensor:** [PUBLISHER NAME], a [STATE] [ENTITY TYPE] with principal place of business at [ADDRESS] ("Publisher")
>
> **Licensee:** [AI COMPANY NAME], a [STATE] [ENTITY TYPE] with principal place of business at [ADDRESS] ("AI Company")
>
> **RECITALS:**
>
> WHEREAS, Publisher owns or controls rights to a corpus of written content, including articles, images, and multimedia assets (collectively, "Licensed Content");
>
> WHEREAS, AI Company develops artificial intelligence models and systems that require training data;
>
> WHEREAS, Publisher wishes to license Licensed Content to AI Company for the purpose of training AI models, subject to the terms and conditions herein;
>
> NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties agree as follows:

Recitals establish intent—critical for interpreting ambiguous clauses later.

## Section 2: Definitions

Define AI-specific terms to prevent disputes.

**Essential Definitions:**

> **"AI Model"** means any machine learning model, neural network, large language model, or other artificial intelligence system developed, trained, or operated by Licensee.
>
> **"Training"** means the computational process by which an AI Model learns patterns, relationships, and representations from Licensed Content, including but not limited to pre-training, fine-tuning, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
>
> **"Inference"** means the runtime application of a trained AI Model to generate outputs, predictions, or responses, including but not limited to text generation, question answering, summarization, and translation.
>
> **"Licensed Content"** means all textual, graphical, audio, and audiovisual content owned or controlled by Publisher and made available to Licensee pursuant to this Agreement, as specifically identified in Exhibit A.
>
> **"Derivative AI Output"** means any text, image, audio, or other content generated by an AI Model as a result of Inference, where such output incorporates, reflects, or is influenced by Licensed Content used during Training.
>
> **"Model Weights"** means the learned parameters of an AI Model resulting from Training, stored as numerical values in the model architecture.
>
> **"Access Mechanism"** means the technical method by which Licensee obtains Licensed Content, including web crawling, API access, bulk file transfer, or direct database connection, as specified in Exhibit B.

These definitions prevent common disputes:
- Does "training" include fine-tuning? (Yes, explicitly.)
- Can Licensee use content at inference time for retrieval-augmented generation? (Separately negotiated—see Usage Limitations section.)
- What exactly is being licensed? (Defined in Exhibit A to avoid ambiguity.)

## Section 3: Grant of License

Specify what rights Publisher grants AI Company.

**Template Language:**

> **3.1 License Grant.** Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Publisher hereby grants to Licensee a [EXCLUSIVE / NON-EXCLUSIVE], [WORLDWIDE / TERRITORY-LIMITED], [PERPETUAL / TERM-LIMITED], [TRANSFERABLE / NON-TRANSFERABLE] license to:
>
> (a) Access and copy Licensed Content via the Access Mechanism;
>
> (b) Use Licensed Content for Training AI Models owned or operated by Licensee;
>
> (c) Retain Model Weights resulting from Training, including after termination of this Agreement; and
>
> (d) Deploy AI Models containing Model Weights for Inference, subject to attribution requirements in Section 6.
>
> **3.2 Limitations on License.** The license granted herein does NOT permit Licensee to:
>
> (a) Redistribute Licensed Content in original or substantially similar form to third parties;
>
> (b) Sub-license Licensed Content to third parties for Training purposes;
>
> (c) Use Licensed Content to train AI Models owned by third parties or provided as training services to third parties ("AI-as-a-Service"), unless separately agreed in writing;
>
> (d) Use Licensed Content for Inference-time retrieval or direct quotation beyond de minimis fair use (longer than [50] words per output); or
>
> (e) Remove or obscure copyright notices, author attributions, or other proprietary markings in Licensed Content.
>
> **3.3 Retained Rights.** Publisher retains all rights not expressly granted herein, including but not limited to rights to license Licensed Content to other parties, publish Licensed Content, and create derivative works.

**Key Negotiation Points:**

**Exclusivity:** Exclusive licenses command 3-10x premiums. **OpenAI** paid **News Corp** $250M for multi-year exclusive access (reported 2024). Most publishers grant non-exclusive to maximize revenue across multiple AI buyers.

**Perpetual vs. Term-Limited:** AI companies prefer perpetual (train once, use forever). Publishers prefer term-limited (renegotiate when models need fresh data). Compromise: Perpetual Model Weights retention (can't "untrain") but time-limited access to new content.

**Transferability:** Non-transferable prevents Licensee from selling trained models (with your content baked in) to competitors. Transferable permits model sales—acceptable if attribution/revenue-sharing survives transfer.

**Model Weight Retention:** Critical clause. Even after contract termination, AI companies retain already-trained Model Weights. Publishers cannot force "deletion" of content from neural networks. This mirrors copyright law—license to create derivative work (trained model) persists even if source license expires.

## Section 4: Usage Limitations

Quantify and restrict access to prevent abuse.

**Template Language:**

> **4.1 Content Volume Limits.** Licensee may access up to [NUMBER] discrete content items (articles, pages, media files) per [MONTH / QUARTER / YEAR] ("Volume Cap"). Content accessed in excess of the Volume Cap shall be subject to Overage Fees as specified in Section 5.3.
>
> **4.2 Crawl Rate Limits.** If access occurs via web crawling, Licensee agrees to:
> (a) Identify crawler via User-Agent string: "[LICENSEE_BOT_NAME]/[VERSION]"
> (b) Limit requests to no more than [NUMBER] requests per minute per domain
> (c) Honor robots.txt directives for paths excluded from this license
> (d) Crawl only during [TIME WINDOW] to minimize server load
>
> **4.3 Content Category Restrictions.** Licensed Content excludes:
> (a) Content in categories listed in Exhibit C (e.g., medical advice, legal advice, user-generated comments)
> (b) Content published before [DATE] or after [DATE]
> (c) Content marked with metadata tag "ai-exclude: true"
> (d) Paywalled or subscriber-only content unless separately agreed
>
> **4.4 Prohibited Use Cases.** Licensee shall not use Licensed Content to train AI Models designed to:
> (a) Generate synthetic articles mimicking Publisher's editorial voice or brand
> (b) Compete directly with Publisher's content products
> (c) Produce misinformation, defamatory content, or illegal material
> (d) Violate third-party intellectual property rights
>
> **4.5 Model Disclosure.** Licensee shall disclose to Publisher which AI Models include Licensed Content in their training corpus, including model names, versions, and deployment dates, within [30] days of initial deployment.

**Rationale for Each Limitation:**

**Volume Caps** enable tiered pricing—baseline fee covers X articles, overage fees apply beyond. Mirrors SaaS pricing (pay more for higher usage).

**Rate Limits** prevent infrastructure overload. [AI crawler traffic can overwhelm servers](ai-crawler-traffic-analytics.html) if unrestricted.

**Category Restrictions** protect Publisher from liability (medical/legal advice training creates regulatory risk) and brand dilution (user comments may contain offensive material).

**Prohibited Use Cases** prevent Licensee from training competitive AI that cannibalizes Publisher's audience (e.g., training a "fake NY Times" generator).

**Model Disclosure** enables monitoring—if Licensee trains 10 models but only disclosed 3, audit rights trigger.

## Section 5: Compensation and Payment

Structure pricing for AI training economics.

**Template Language:**

> **5.1 License Fee.** Licensee shall pay Publisher an annual license fee of $[AMOUNT] ("Base Fee"), payable [IN ADVANCE / QUARTERLY / MONTHLY] via wire transfer to the account specified by Publisher.
>
> **5.2 Volume-Based Pricing.** The Base Fee covers access to up to [NUMBER] content items per year. If Licensee's usage models justify alternative pricing, parties may elect one of the following:
>
> (a) **Per-Article Pricing:** $[AMOUNT] per discrete article accessed, invoiced monthly based on access logs.
>
> (b) **CPM Pricing:** $[AMOUNT] per 1,000 content items accessed (Cost Per Mille model), invoiced quarterly.
>
> (c) **Tiered Pricing:**
>     - Tier 1: 0-100,000 articles @ $[AMOUNT] flat fee
>     - Tier 2: 100,001-500,000 articles @ $[AMOUNT] per article
>     - Tier 3: 500,001+ articles @ $[AMOUNT] per article
>
> **5.3 Overage Fees.** Access exceeding Volume Caps shall incur overage charges of $[AMOUNT] per content item above the cap, invoiced within [30] days of quarter-end. Continued access after receiving overage invoice constitutes acceptance of charges.
>
> **5.4 Attribution-Based Revenue Share.** If AI Model outputs include citations or attributions to Publisher (as required by Section 6), and such citations generate measurable traffic to Publisher's website, Licensee shall pay Publisher [X]% of net advertising revenue attributable to such referred traffic, calculated quarterly.
>
> **5.5 Audit-Based Adjustments.** If Publisher's audit (Section 7) reveals Licensee accessed Licensed Content in excess of reported volumes by more than [10]%, Licensee shall pay:
> (a) Underpaid license fees based on actual access volumes
> (b) A penalty equal to [50]% of underpaid amount
> (c) Reasonable costs of audit
>
> **5.6 Payment Terms.** All fees are due within [30] days of invoice date. Late payments accrue interest at [1.5]% per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower.
>
> **5.7 Price Escalation.** The Base Fee shall increase annually by the greater of [3]% or the CPI-U inflation rate, effective each anniversary of the Effective Date.

**Pricing Model Selection Guidance:**

**Fixed Annual Fee:** Simple, predictable. Best for established relationships where usage is stable. Typical range: $50K-$10M annually depending on content volume and publisher size.

**Per-Article Pricing:** Aligns cost with value. AI companies training on millions of articles pay proportionally more. Typical rates: $0.02-$0.50 per article, depending on quality and exclusivity. [Industry rate card benchmarks](ai-licensing-rate-cards-industry.html) inform pricing.

**CPM Model:** Treats AI crawler traffic like ad impressions. Familiar to publishers; easy to calculate. Typical CPM: $2-$5 for training access (vs. $1-$10 for display ads).

**Tiered Pricing:** Incentivizes volume commitments. AI companies pre-purchase tiers, reducing marginal cost at scale. Mirrors enterprise SaaS contracts.

**Revenue Share on Attribution:** Converts training license into ongoing referral partnership. If **Claude** cites your articles and users click through, you earn ad revenue plus referral fees. This aligns incentives—[Anthropic benefits from attribution](anthropic-publisher-licensing-strategy.html), Publisher benefits from traffic.

## Section 6: Attribution and Publicity

AI-generated outputs should credit source content—but implementation is technically complex.

**Template Language:**

> **6.1 Attribution Requirement.** When an AI Model generates Derivative AI Output that incorporates or is substantially derived from Licensed Content, Licensee shall ensure the output includes:
>
> (a) **In-Line Citation:** Reference to Publisher and specific article URL (e.g., "According to [Publisher Name], [URL]...") when output closely paraphrases or quotes Licensed Content.
>
> (b) **Source List:** For outputs synthesizing multiple sources, a list of contributing sources including Publisher, displayed prominently alongside output (e.g., footnotes, sidebar, "Sources" section).
>
> (c) **General Disclosure:** If in-line citation is impractical, a general disclosure that AI Model was trained on Licensed Content, displayed in model documentation or user-facing interface.
>
> **6.2 Attribution Standards.** Citations shall:
> - Include hyperlinks (for digital outputs) to original Publisher content
> - Identify Publisher by full legal name or recognized brand name
> - Not misrepresent Publisher's views or suggest endorsement
> - Remain visible and accessible (no hidden or obfuscated attributions)
>
> **6.3 Technical Implementation.** Licensee shall implement reasonable technical measures to enable attribution, including:
> - Metadata tagging during Training associating Licensed Content with Publisher identity
> - Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that track source documents
> - Logging mechanisms recording which Licensed Content influenced specific outputs
>
> **6.4 Attribution Monitoring.** Publisher may periodically test AI Model outputs by submitting queries likely to retrieve Licensed Content. Licensee shall cooperate with such testing and address attribution failures within [30] days of notice.
>
> **6.5 Publicity Rights.** Licensee may publicly disclose this licensing partnership, including in press releases, investor presentations, and marketing materials, subject to Publisher's prior written approval (not to be unreasonably withheld). Publisher may similarly disclose the partnership.

**Why Attribution Matters:**

**Traffic and Revenue:** Citations drive referral traffic, recovering audience lost to [AI search redistribution](ai-search-traffic-redistribution.html).

**Brand Visibility:** Even without clicks, appearing as a cited source builds authority. Users see "According to [Publisher]" and perceive expertise.

**Legal Protection:** Attribution strengthens fair use defenses. Citing sources demonstrates transformative use, reducing copyright infringement risk.

**Moral Rights:** In jurisdictions recognizing moral rights (Europe, Canada), attribution may be legally required regardless of contract.

**Technical Challenges:**

AI models don't natively "remember" which training documents influenced specific outputs. Implementing attribution requires:
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Fetching source documents at inference time, enabling direct citation
- **Training Metadata:** Tagging every training example with source ID, then using attention mechanisms to identify influential sources
- **Post-Hoc Matching:** Comparing outputs to training corpus, flagging likely sources (imprecise but scalable)

Publishers should negotiate "best efforts" attribution rather than absolute guarantees—current AI architectures make perfect attribution infeasible.

## Section 7: Audit Rights

Trust but verify. Audit clauses enable enforcement.

**Template Language:**

> **7.1 Audit Entitlement.** Publisher may audit Licensee's use of Licensed Content up to [twice per year / once per quarter], upon [30] days' written notice.
>
> **7.2 Audit Scope.** Audits may include:
> (a) Review of access logs showing Licensed Content retrieval (dates, volumes, content IDs)
> (b) Inspection of AI Model documentation identifying which models include Licensed Content
> (c) Testing of AI Model outputs to verify attribution compliance
> (d) Review of Licensee's internal records regarding Licensed Content usage and payments
>
> **7.3 Audit Methodology.** Audits shall be conducted by Publisher's employees or third-party auditors bound by confidentiality obligations. Auditors may:
> - Access Licensee's facilities during business hours
> - Review electronic records, logs, and databases
> - Interview Licensee personnel responsible for AI training operations
> - Test AI Model behavior via black-box queries
>
> **7.4 Audit Cooperation.** Licensee shall provide reasonable cooperation, including:
> - Timely production of requested records
> - Access to technical staff for interviews
> - Secure environment for auditor access to sensitive systems
>
> **7.5 Audit Findings.** Within [30] days of audit completion, auditors shall deliver findings report to both parties. If findings reveal:
> (a) Underpayment >10%: Licensee pays shortfall + penalty per Section 5.5
> (b) Material breach: Publisher may terminate per Section 11.2
> (c) No material issues: Parties continue under existing terms
>
> **7.6 Audit Costs.** Publisher bears audit costs unless findings reveal underpayment >10%, in which case Licensee reimburses reasonable audit expenses.
>
> **7.7 Audit Confidentiality.** Auditors shall maintain confidentiality of Licensee's proprietary information unrelated to Licensed Content compliance. Audit findings shall not be publicly disclosed without mutual consent.

**Audit Rights in Practice:**

AI companies resist invasive audits (training pipelines are trade secrets). Negotiate:
- **Log-based audits:** Less intrusive than facility inspections. Licensee exports access logs; Publisher's auditors analyze off-site.
- **Third-party auditors:** Neutral parties (e.g., accounting firms) reduce AI company concern about trade secret exposure.
- **Automated compliance monitoring:** [API gateway architectures](api-gateway-ai-crawler-access.html) generate real-time usage reports, reducing audit need.

Audits catch underpayment (Licensee accessed 2M articles but reported 500K) and unauthorized use (Licensee trained models beyond license scope).

## Section 8: Representations and Warranties

Parties vouch for their authority and performance.

**Template Language:**

> **8.1 Publisher Representations.** Publisher represents and warrants that:
> (a) Publisher owns or controls sufficient rights to grant the license herein
> (b) Licensed Content does not infringe third-party intellectual property rights
> (c) Publisher has obtained necessary permissions from contributors (employees, freelancers, UGC authors) to grant this license
> (d) Licensed Content complies with applicable laws (defamation, privacy, export controls)
>
> **8.2 Licensee Representations.** Licensee represents and warrants that:
> (a) Licensee will use Licensed Content only as permitted by this Agreement
> (b) Licensee will implement reasonable security measures to prevent unauthorized access to Licensed Content
> (c) Licensee will comply with all applicable laws governing AI development and deployment
> (d) Licensee will not reverse-engineer or attempt to extract original Licensed Content from Model Weights
>
> **8.3 Disclaimer of Warranties.** EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, PUBLISHER PROVIDES LICENSED CONTENT "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR ACCURACY. PUBLISHER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT LICENSED CONTENT IS ERROR-FREE OR THAT ACCESS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED.

**Why These Warranties Matter:**

**Publisher's IP Warranty:** If Publisher licensed content they didn't have rights to (e.g., freelancer retained copyright), Licensee can sue for breach of warranty when the freelancer sues Licensee for infringement. This makes Publisher responsible for clearing rights.

**No Reverse-Engineering Clause:** Prevents Licensee from training a "content extraction" model that reconstructs Publisher's articles from Model Weights—a form of indirect redistribution.

**As-Is Disclaimer:** Limits Publisher liability for content errors. If an article contains factual mistakes and AI Model propagates those errors, Publisher isn't liable (absent negligence or fraud).

## Section 9: Indemnification

Who pays legal bills if third parties sue?

**Template Language:**

> **9.1 Publisher Indemnification.** Publisher shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Licensee from any claims, damages, or expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising from:
> (a) Breach of Publisher's representations regarding ownership or rights in Licensed Content
> (b) Infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by Licensed Content
> (c) Defamation, privacy violations, or other torts in Licensed Content
>
> **9.2 Licensee Indemnification.** Licensee shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Publisher from any claims, damages, or expenses arising from:
> (a) Licensee's use of Licensed Content outside the scope of this Agreement
> (b) Derivative AI Outputs that infringe third-party rights or violate laws
> (c) Licensee's failure to comply with attribution requirements
> (d) Security breaches resulting in unauthorized access to Licensed Content via Licensee's systems
>
> **9.3 Indemnification Procedure.** The indemnified party shall:
> (a) Promptly notify indemnifying party of any claim
> (b) Cooperate in defense of claim
> (c) Allow indemnifying party to control defense and settlement (subject to indemnified party's approval of settlements affecting its rights)

**Indemnification Negotiations:**

Publishers want Licensee to indemnify for **all** AI output liability (including copyright claims like **NYT v. OpenAI**). AI companies resist, arguing training is fair use.

Compromise: Licensee indemnifies for uses **outside** license scope (e.g., redistributing original articles) but not for fair use claims related to training itself. Copyright liability risk shifts to whichever party has stronger fair use argument—usually AI company, but [AI training copyright case law](ai-training-data-copyright.html) remains unsettled.

## Section 10: Confidentiality

Protect trade secrets disclosed during performance.

**Template Language:**

> **10.1 Confidential Information.** "Confidential Information" includes all non-public information disclosed by one party to the other, including but not limited to:
> - Financial terms of this Agreement (pricing, payment amounts)
> - Technical specifications (Access Mechanisms, API keys, crawler infrastructure)
> - Business strategies (planned AI models, product roadmaps)
> - Performance data (content access volumes, attribution metrics)
>
> **10.2 Obligations.** Receiving party shall:
> (a) Maintain confidentiality using reasonable care (at least the same care used for its own confidential information)
> (b) Not disclose Confidential Information to third parties without disclosing party's prior written consent
> (c) Use Confidential Information only for purposes of performing this Agreement
>
> **10.3 Exceptions.** Confidentiality obligations do not apply to information that:
> (a) Was publicly known at time of disclosure
> (b) Becomes publicly known through no breach by receiving party
> (c) Was rightfully in receiving party's possession before disclosure
> (d) Is independently developed by receiving party without using Confidential Information
> (e) Must be disclosed pursuant to law, regulation, or court order (with prior notice to disclosing party)

**Why Confidentiality Matters:**

**Pricing Secrecy:** Publishers don't want competitors knowing they licensed content to **OpenAI** for $X (other AI companies might low-ball). AI companies don't want revealing they paid $Y (other publishers might demand more).

**Technical Security:** Access Mechanisms (API keys, IP whitelists) are sensitive—disclosure enables unauthorized access.

**Competitive Intelligence:** Knowing which AI models include a publisher's content reveals that AI company's product roadmap.

Most AI licensing deals include mutual non-disclosure of financial terms.

## Section 11: Term and Termination

How long does the license last? How do parties exit?

**Template Language:**

> **11.1 Term.** This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and continues for an initial term of [LENGTH] ("Initial Term"), unless earlier terminated. Thereafter, the Agreement automatically renews for successive [LENGTH] periods ("Renewal Terms"), unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least [90] days before the end of the then-current term.
>
> **11.2 Termination for Cause.** Either party may terminate immediately upon written notice if:
> (a) The other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure within [30] days of notice
> (b) The other party becomes insolvent, files bankruptcy, or ceases business operations
> (c) Continuing the Agreement would violate applicable law
>
> **11.3 Termination for Convenience.** [Publisher / Licensee / Either party] may terminate this Agreement without cause upon [180] days' written notice.
>
> **11.4 Effect of Termination.** Upon termination:
> (a) Licensee's right to access new Licensed Content ceases immediately
> (b) Licensee may retain Model Weights from Training completed before termination ("Survivor Rights")
> (c) Licensee shall cease distributing or licensing Licensed Content in original form
> (d) Attribution obligations survive termination with respect to AI Models retaining Survivor Rights
> (e) All unpaid fees become immediately due
> (f) Sections [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14] survive termination
>
> **11.5 Data Deletion.** Within [30] days of termination, Licensee shall delete all copies of Licensed Content in its possession, except:
> (a) Licensed Content embedded in Model Weights (cannot be deleted without destroying model)
> (b) Archival copies retained for legal compliance (must be secured and not accessed except for legal purposes)

**Critical Negotiation: Survivor Rights**

Can Licensee keep using trained models after contract ends? This is the **most contentious** clause.

**Publisher Position:** "You can train during the contract term, but models must be retired upon termination." Impractical—AI companies can't "untrain" models.

**AI Company Position:** "Model Weights survive indefinitely." Publishers lose leverage—AI company pays once, uses forever.

**Compromise:** Survivor Rights with caveats:
- Models trained during contract survive
- But future re-training requires new license
- Attribution obligations survive (even for old models)
- If Publisher licenses to AI Company's competitor, non-compete provisions may sunset

Another compromise: **Depreciation License**—Survivor Rights last [X years] post-termination, then models must be retired or re-licensed. Accounts for [model collapse from stale data](ai-model-collapse-fresh-data.html)—models older than 2-3 years need fresh training anyway.

## Section 12: Data Protection and Privacy

GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy laws impose obligations.

**Template Language:**

> **12.1 Data Processing Agreement.** To the extent Licensed Content includes personal data (as defined by GDPR, CCPA, or other applicable privacy laws), the parties shall execute a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) in the form attached as Exhibit D.
>
> **12.2 Privacy Obligations.** Licensee shall:
> (a) Process personal data only as necessary for Training AI Models
> (b) Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data
> (c) Not attempt to re-identify anonymized individuals in Licensed Content
> (d) Comply with data subject rights requests (access, deletion, portability) as communicated by Publisher
>
> **12.3 Cross-Border Transfers.** If Licensee transfers Licensed Content outside the jurisdiction where Publisher is located, Licensee shall implement Standard Contractual Clauses or other lawful transfer mechanisms as required by applicable law.
>
> **12.4 Breach Notification.** Licensee shall notify Publisher within [72] hours of discovering any security breach affecting Licensed Content or personal data therein.

**GDPR Implications:**

If Licensed Content includes EU residents' personal data (names, emails in articles), Licensee may be a "data processor" and Publisher a "data controller." This triggers GDPR obligations:
- DPA required
- Data minimization (only process data necessary for training)
- Right to deletion (if individual requests deletion, must remove from future training—though can't remove from existing Model Weights)

Many publishers strip personally identifiable information before licensing to avoid GDPR complexity.

## Section 13: Dispute Resolution

How to resolve conflicts.

**Template Language:**

> **13.1 Negotiation.** Disputes shall first be escalated to senior executives (Publisher's CEO and Licensee's CEO or equivalent), who shall meet in good faith to resolve within [30] days.
>
> **13.2 Mediation.** If negotiation fails, parties shall participate in mediation administered by [AAA / JAMS / other provider], with costs split equally.
>
> **13.3 Arbitration.** If mediation fails, disputes shall be resolved by binding arbitration under [AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules / JAMS / other], conducted in [CITY, STATE]. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding, enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.
>
> **13.4 Exceptions.** Either party may seek injunctive relief in court for:
> (a) Breaches of confidentiality obligations
> (b) Intellectual property infringement
> (c) Unauthorized access to Licensed Content beyond license scope
>
> **13.5 Governing Law.** This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of [STATE / COUNTRY], without regard to conflicts of law principles.

**Why Arbitration?**

Privacy—arbitration is confidential; litigation is public. Neither party wants licensing terms revealed in court filings.

Speed—arbitration resolves faster than litigation (months vs. years).

Expertise—parties can select arbitrators with AI/IP expertise rather than random juries.

## Section 14: General Provisions

Boilerplate—but important.

**Template Language:**

> **14.1 Entire Agreement.** This Agreement, including all exhibits, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties regarding the subject matter and supersedes all prior agreements, representations, or understandings.
>
> **14.2 Amendments.** This Agreement may be amended only by written instrument signed by both parties.
>
> **14.3 Assignment.** Neither party may assign this Agreement without the other's prior written consent, except assignments to affiliates or successors in connection with mergers, acquisitions, or sales of substantially all assets.
>
> **14.4 Notices.** All notices shall be in writing, delivered to the addresses specified above via email (with confirmation of receipt) or certified mail.
>
> **14.5 Severability.** If any provision is found invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in effect.
>
> **14.6 Waiver.** Failure to enforce any provision does not waive the right to enforce it later.
>
> **14.7 Force Majeure.** Neither party is liable for delays caused by events beyond reasonable control (acts of God, war, pandemics, government actions).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I modify this template for non-AI licensing deals?

This template is AI-specific (addresses Model Weights, Inference, attribution in AI context). For traditional syndication or reprint licensing, use standard media licensing agreements. However, sections on compensation, audit rights, and confidentiality can be adapted. Key differences: traditional licensing doesn't need "Model Weight survival" clauses or "derivative AI output" definitions.

### What if AI company refuses to accept attribution requirements?

Attribution is negotiable leverage. Large publishers (**NYT**, **News Corp**) successfully demanded attribution; smaller publishers have less power. If Licensee refuses, consider: (1) higher base fees compensating for lost referral traffic, (2) non-compete clauses preventing Licensee from licensing content to your competitors (exclusivity trade-off), or (3) walking away—if attribution is strategically critical for your [attention-to-training economy transition](attention-economy-vs-training-economy.html), no-attribution deal may be revenue-negative.

### How do I enforce the contract if AI company violates terms?

Enforcement depends on breach type. For underpayment (Section 5 violations), audit rights (Section 7) provide evidence for litigation. For unauthorized content distribution (Section 3 limitations), injunctive relief is available. For attribution failures (Section 6), remedies include payment withholding, contract termination, or specific performance (court orders requiring compliance). Most disputes resolve via negotiation—litigation is expensive and slow. Strong audit rights and clear breach definitions make violations provable, increasing settlement leverage.

### Should I require Licensee to disclose which AI models are trained on my content?

Yes, if feasible. Model disclosure (Section 4.5) enables monitoring—test models for attribution compliance, track which models become commercially successful (revenue-share triggers), and verify Model Weights aren't transferred to unauthorized parties. However, AI companies resist disclosure for competitive reasons (don't want revealing product roadmap). Compromise: disclose model categories (e.g., "conversational AI," "search," "code generation") without specific product names, or disclose only after public launch.

### What happens to the license if the AI company gets acquired?

Depends on assignment clause (Section 14.3). Most agreements prohibit assignment without consent, but include exceptions for acquisitions. If **OpenAI** acquires **Anthropic**, can **Anthropic** use content licensed to **OpenAI**? Not automatically—licenses are entity-specific unless explicitly transferable. Negotiate "change of control" provisions: if Licensee is acquired by a competitor or entity you'd refuse to license, you can terminate. Or require acquirer to assume license obligations, converting acquisition into expansion of licensed use.
