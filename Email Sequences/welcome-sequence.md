# Welcome Email Sequence — AI Pay Per Crawl

5-email sequence. Goal: Build trust, educate on AI licensing landscape, position aipaypercrawl.com as authority. Cadence: Day 0, Day 2, Day 5, Day 9, Day 14.

---

## Email 1 — Day 0

**Subject:** Your content is being scraped 73,000 times (here's what to do)

**Preview:** AI companies owe you money. Most publishers don't know how to collect it.

**PASAIDA Element:** Problem

---

You signed up because you know AI crawlers are scraping your site.

What you might not know: Anthropic's ClaudeBot scraped 73,000 times for every 1 referral it sent back. OpenAI's GPTBot isn't far behind. Google's Gemini crawlers extract your content for AI Overviews that send zero traffic.

They're training billion-dollar models on your archives. You're earning $0.

Most publishers respond by blocking. 75% block CCBot. 69% block ClaudeBot. 62% block GPTBot.

Blocking stops the scraping. It doesn't pay the bills.

Cloudflare launched Pay-Per-Crawl in July 2025. News Corp signed a $250M deal with OpenAI. Reddit licensed to Google for $60M annually. The Financial Times partnered with Anthropic.

The question isn't whether AI companies will pay for content. It's whether you'll be ready when they come asking.

Over the next two weeks I'll send you the frameworks mid-size publishers are using to monetize AI crawlers without hiring licensing lawyers.

First lesson arrives Thursday: how to identify which AI crawlers are scraping your site right now (and what that tells you about pricing leverage).

## Email 2 — Day 2

**Subject:** What you lose by blocking AI crawlers

**Preview:** Hint: it's not SEO. It's something bigger.

**PASAIDA Element:** Agitation

---

Common fear: "If I block AI crawlers, will Google penalize my site?"

Short answer: No. Blocking GPTBot doesn't affect Googlebot. Blocking Google-Extended (Gemini's training crawler) doesn't harm search rankings.

Research from 50+ publisher case studies confirms it. AI crawler blocking has zero SEO downside.

So why don't more publishers monetize instead of block?

Three reasons:

Information gap. They don't know the difference between training crawls (rare, deep archive scrapes) vs. retrieval crawls (frequent, real-time queries). Different economics. Different pricing.

Technical overwhelm. robots.txt, RSL protocol, llms.txt, Cloudflare dashboard configuration. Fragmented tutorials. No single implementation guide.

No benchmarks. What's a fair per-crawl rate? What did News Corp actually negotiate (vs. what the press release said)? Zero transparency.

While you're stuck in analysis paralysis, AI companies are making the choice for you. They scrape. You earn nothing. The archive you spent years building funds someone else's product roadmap.

Cloudflare's Pay-Per-Crawl solves the enforcement problem (automated billing, crawler detection, payment processing). But it doesn't solve the strategy problem.

That's what the next email covers: the three AI licensing models (marketplace vs. direct deal vs. hybrid) and which one fits your publication.

Arrives Monday.

## Email 3 — Day 5

**Subject:** The 3 paths to AI licensing revenue

**Preview:** Marketplace, direct deal, or hybrid. Here's how to choose.

**PASAIDA Element:** Solution

---

Three ways to license your content to AI companies:

**Path 1: Marketplace (Cloudflare Pay-Per-Crawl + RSL)**

You set per-crawl rates in Cloudflare dashboard. AI companies that comply get access, non-payers get blocked/throttled. Automated billing via Stripe. Best for mid-size publishers (1M-50M monthly pageviews) with limited legal resources. Expected revenue: $500-$5,000/month depending on crawler activity. Setup time: 2-4 hours with the right guide.

**Path 2: Direct Deal (News Corp / Reddit / AP model)**

Custom contract negotiated with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta. Flat annual fee (often $5M-$250M for large publishers). Attribution requirements, audit rights, multi-year terms. Best for large publishers (50M+ pageviews) or irreplaceable niche data (technical docs, financial data, user-generated content at scale). Expected revenue: $500,000-$50M+ annually. Setup time: 3-9 months (legal, negotiation, contract execution).

**Path 3: Hybrid (Marketplace + Selective Direct Deals)**

Use Cloudflare for retrieval crawls (ongoing, low-value scraping). Negotiate separately for training data rights (one-time archive licensing). Block aggressive crawlers, license to compliant ones. Best for publishers with unique archives + ongoing high-value content. Expected revenue: $2,000-$20,000/month (marketplace) + $100,000-$5M (direct deal). Setup time: 4-6 weeks (marketplace first, direct deal pipeline second).

Most publishers reading this should start with Path 1. Get Cloudflare Pay-Per-Crawl running, generate baseline revenue, use that data to negotiate direct deals later.

## Email 4 — Day 9

**Subject:** What a $1,200/month AI licensing win looks like

**Preview:** B2B publisher, 8M monthly pageviews, 9 months in. Here's the breakdown.

**PASAIDA Element:** Authority

---

Client case study (details anonymized per NDA):

**Publication type:** B2B trade publication (construction industry)
**Monthly pageviews:** 8 million
**Crawler activity baseline:** 14,000 AI bot requests/day (mix of GPTBot, ClaudeBot, Google-Extended, Bytespider)
**Implementation:** Cloudflare Pay-Per-Crawl + RSL protocol
**Pricing model:** Tiered per-crawl (news: $0.003, technical guides: $0.012, proprietary data: $0.020)

**Results after 9 months:**

AI crawler compliance rate: 38% (OpenAI, Anthropic compliant; Bytespider, others blocked). Monthly revenue: $1,200 average (range: $800-$1,900 depending on news cycle). Traffic impact: Zero change to organic search traffic (Googlebot unaffected). Setup time: 6 hours total (Cloudflare config, RSL file, pricing strategy).

**What they learned:**

ClaudeBot pays, GPTBot negotiates. Anthropic complied immediately with published rates. OpenAI requested volume discount (granted after 60 days of payment).

Bytespider ignores everything. Chinese AI crawlers (ByteDance, Baidu) don't honor robots.txt or RSL. Solution: Cloudflare firewall rules blocking by IP range.

Pricing tiers work. News content priced low ($0.003/crawl) for volume. Proprietary research priced 6x higher ($0.020/crawl). AI companies paid both rates without complaint.

Revenue is secondary (for now). $1,200/month doesn't replace ad revenue. But it's a new revenue stream with zero editorial overhead. And it's growing 15% quarterly as more AI companies launch compliant crawlers.

This client started with our $2,500 implementation package. ROI hit in month 3. They've since referred 4 other trade publications.

Next email (final in this sequence): Your decision point. What to do next.

## Email 5 — Day 14

**Subject:** Last email (then you're on your own)

**Preview:** Here's what happens if you do nothing.

**PASAIDA Element:** Incentive + Deadline + Action

---

Two futures:

**Future 1: You do nothing.**

AI crawlers keep scraping. 73,000 requests per referral. Zero revenue. Your archive trains GPT-6, Claude 5, Gemini Ultra. The content you spent years creating funds someone else's billion-dollar valuation.

In 18 months, AI licensing becomes table stakes. Every major publisher has a deal. Pricing benchmarks are public. AI companies have leverage ("everyone else charges $0.002/crawl, why should we pay you more?").

You're late to a market you should've entered early.

**Future 2: You implement now.**

Cloudflare Pay-Per-Crawl configured this month. RSL file live. Pricing strategy based on your crawler activity baseline (not industry guesses). AI companies that comply get access. Non-payers get blocked.

First revenue in 30-60 days. Data collection starts immediately (which crawlers pay, which ignore terms, which content they value most).

In 18 months, you've got 18 months of pricing data. You know what AI companies will pay. You have leverage for direct deal negotiations. You're not guessing — you're negotiating from strength.

**What to do next:**

**Option 1 (DIY):** Download The Publisher's AI Licensing Playbook. Follow the checklist. Configure Cloudflare yourself. Budget 6-8 hours.

**Option 2 (Done-for-you):** Book the $2,500 Implementation Package. I audit your crawler activity, recommend pricing tiers, configure Cloudflare, draft RSL file, test for 14 days, adjust based on results. Done in 3 weeks.

**Option 3 (Enterprise):** If you're 50M+ monthly pageviews or have irreplaceable niche data, skip Cloudflare and go straight to direct deal negotiations. $25,000 for full licensing strategy (research, contract drafting, negotiation support, deal execution). Email victor@aipaypercrawl.com for scope call.

**Option 4 (Do nothing):** Unsubscribe below. I won't email again. Your crawlers will keep scraping. Good luck.

This is the last email in this sequence. You've got the frameworks. You've got the case studies. You've got the templates.

What you do with them is up to you.

Victor

P.S. — Implementation package has 3 spots left this month (capacity constraint: I personally configure all setups). First-come, first-served.
