**How Mid-Size Publishers Monetize AI Crawlers Without Hiring Licensing Lawyers**

## BELOW THE FOLD

---

### SECTION 1: Problem

**73,000 crawls for every 1 referral.**

That's what Anthropic's ClaudeBot takes from your archives while sending nothing back. OpenAI's GPTBot scrapes your technical docs. Google's Gemini crawlers index your research reports. ByteDance's Bytespider ignores your robots.txt entirely.

They're training billion-dollar models on your content.

You earn zero.

---

### SECTION 2: Agitate (Pain)

The standard publisher response: block everything. 75% now block CCBot. 69% block ClaudeBot. 62% block GPTBot.

Blocking stops the scraping. It doesn't generate revenue.

Meanwhile, publishers with infrastructure are getting paid:
- News Corp: $250M deal with OpenAI
- Reddit: $60M annually from Google
- Financial Times: Direct partnership with Anthropic
- AP: Licensing agreements across multiple AI companies

The difference isn't legal teams or traffic volume. It's implementation. They built systems to enforce payment for access.

You're running a website. They're running a licensing operation.

---

### SECTION 3: Solution

Cloudflare launched Pay-Per-Crawl in July 2025. The RSL protocol standardized machine-readable licensing terms. The llms.txt specification lets AI systems understand your terms in natural language.

The tools exist.

**The Publisher's AI Licensing Playbook** gives you everything needed to configure them:

### SECTION 6: De-Risk

**This isn't legal advice. It's implementation.**

You don't need a licensing lawyer to configure Cloudflare's Pay-Per-Crawl dashboard. You don't need a $250M legal budget to deploy an RSL file. You don't need a dedicated partnerships team to monitor crawler compliance.

You need checklists. Templates. Benchmarks.

40 pages. Zero fluff. Every template tested against the protocols that OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google actually read.

**Plus: Two Follow-Up Lessons**

- Week 1: Common Setup Mistakes (the four ways publishers break AI crawler monetization)
- Week 2: Enforcement Strategies (what to do when AI companies ignore your terms)

---

### SECTION 7: CTA (Repeat)

### Form (Second Placement)

**Fields:**
- Email (required)
- Publication name (required)
- Monthly pageviews (dropdown: Under 1M / 1M-10M / 10M-50M / 50M+)

**CTA Button:**
"Send Me The Playbook"

### Urgency Element

"Cloudflare Pay-Per-Crawl adoption is doubling quarterly. Publishers who implement now capture first-mover pricing power before AI companies negotiate standardized lower rates."

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Above-the-Fold Requirements

- Headline must be visible without scrolling on desktop and mobile
- Form embedded directly below subheadline (no "click to reveal")
- Trust signal positioned immediately below CTA button
- No navigation menu above the fold (minimize exit points)

### Design Direction

- Single column layout
- High contrast headline (dark text on light background)
- Form with visible borders (not floating/minimal)
- CTA button in accent color (suggest orange or blue)
- Pricing table and case study section need visual separation (alternate background)

### Tracking

- Form submission → email sequence trigger (welcome-sequence.md)
- UTM parameters for traffic source attribution
- Scroll depth tracking for optimization

### A/B Test Candidates

1. Headline: "How Mid-Size Publishers..." vs. "The 6-Hour Setup That..."
2. CTA button: "Send Me The Playbook" vs. "Get Instant Access"
3. Form fields: With/without "Monthly pageviews" (test friction)
4. Trust signal: Subscriber count vs. specific publisher logos (when available)
